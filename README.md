# 🚗 Car Side View Vector Illustration - Replica Project

Welcome to my **Car Side View Vector Illustration** project! This repository showcases my attempt to recreate a car's side view and tire using **Adobe Illustrator**. Below, you’ll find a PDF comparison between my vector illustration and the original car.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I created a **vector replica** of a car’s side view, paying close attention to details such as the tire design and overall car shape. The **vector illustration** was created using **Adobe Illustrator**, and the final result is displayed in a PDF file that also includes the **original car image** I used as a reference.

## 📄 Files Included

- **`car-side-view-replica-comparison.pdf`**  
  A PDF that contains:
  1. The **vector illustration** I created of the car's side view and tire.
  2. The **original car reference** used to inspire the vector illustration.

- **`car.ai`**  
  The original **Adobe Illustrator (.ai)** file of the vector car illustration.

- **`car-tire-side-view.ai`**  
  The **Adobe Illustrator (.ai)** file of the vector tire illustration.

## 💡 How to Use

Feel free to:
- Download and explore the vector illustrations.
- Use the `.ai` files to modify the design or use them in your own projects.
- Review the comparison PDF to understand the steps and creativity involved in recreating the car's side view.

## 🚀 Motivation Behind the Project

The motivation for this project stemmed from a desire to practice and improve my vector illustration skills using Adobe Illustrator. By replicating a real-life car, I not only enhanced my vector design abilities but also gained a deeper understanding of how to capture and stylize details in digital artwork.

## 🤝 Contributing

I welcome any contributions or feedback! If you have any suggestions to improve the illustration or if you want to add your own version, feel free to fork this repo and open a pull request.

## 📅 Future Plans

- **More car models**: Creating vector side views of other car models.
- **Additional details**: Adding extra design elements to the cars, such as reflections, shading, and textures.
- **Tutorial**: Plan to create a tutorial or step-by-step guide for others who are interested in learning how to create similar vector illustrations.
